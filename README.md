# Firmware tools
Tools for updating firmware via USB.

This project is intended to be used as a dependency for a firmware CPM package.
It adds the Make target 'update' which updates connected USB devices with the
built firmware.

## requirements
- Python >= 3.5 (lower versions probably work fine as well)
- compatible firmware update server program
